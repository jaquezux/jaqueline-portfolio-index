## ðŸ’® Welcome to my portfolio! <br>
Here you will find some of my featured works and personal projects as a data analyst.

### Analysis

        <td width='100'><strong>Project</td>
        <td width='90'><strong>Stack</td>
        <td><strong>Description</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><a href="https://github.com/jaquezux/SQL-8-week-challenge/blob/main/case-study-1/case-study-1.md">SQL Challenge - Danny's Dinner</a></td>
        <td>PostgreSQL, DBFiddle</td>
        <td>This challenge is important because I learned how to use <strong>SQL RANK functions and practice JOINS</strong>. Besides that, some questions could have more than one answer, and I had to consider how to proceed to cover any situation.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><a href="https://github.com/jaquezux/videogame-sales/blob/main/videogame-sales.ipynb">Video Games Sales</a></td>
        <td>Python, Pandas, Matplotlib</td>
        <td>This is my first exploratory analysis using Python. It was important because I could learn how to use some libraries such as <strong>Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib</strong>. The dataset covers all bestseller games and its platforms in a range of time, so in order to segmenting my analysis, I focused on Shooter genre for Playstation platform.</td>
